Troubleshooting tips
========================

This page describes what to do if you encounter problems when installing or maintaining InterMine.  Please feel free to [wiki:ContactUs contact us] with any questions you may have.

Error messages
--------------

If you encounter a problem when running Ant, try adding the verbose flag:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ant -verbose

This should output a more useful error message.

Logs
----

Data warehouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When integrating data, usually the errors are in intermine.log file in the directory you are in, eg. `/integrate` or `/dbmodel`

Webapp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for the intermine webapp to write logs, you must correctly set the `webapp.logdir` property in your mine properties file. The property must be an absolute path to a directory on the tomcat machine, writable by tomcat.

When you see an error on the webapp or get a blank page and nothing appears in the webapp log from log4j, it is likely you will be able to find more information on what went wrong in the tomcat logs:

* tomcat/logs/catalina.out  
* tomcat/logs/localhost.DATE.logs

It will likely be the log that was modified last.  

A good way of looking at the output to these logs in real time is to use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ tail -f tomcat/logs/LOGNAME

If you reload the webapp you will see the error output directly on the screen.

Show all properties 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that you can do this in a running web-app to check that it works by visiting the `HOST/PREFIX/showProperties.do` url when logged in as superuser. 

Common Errors 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Listed here are some common errors encountered in InterMine and some suggested fixes. 

UnsupportedClassVersionError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/intermine/task/FileName (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)

This means that your version of Java is too old, you need at least Java 1.5 to run !InterMine.

can't open datasource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	java.lang.RuntimeException: can't open datasource for {platform=PostgreSQL, datasource.dataSourceName=db.flatmodeunittest, ...

Errors of this type mean there was a problem accessing a database, in this example with `db.flatmodeunittest`.  Either the database specified in the xxx.properties file doesn't exist or the server/user/password details in the properties are incorrect.

FATAL: sorry, too many clients already
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Backend start-up failed: FATAL: sorry, too many clients already - for database: db.bio-fulldata-test

This occurs when the number of connections to a database exceeds the maximum configured in the postgres configuration. You need to increase the value of `max_connections` in the `postgresql.conf` file and restart postgres.  Try 50 connections:

.. code-block:: java

	max_connections = 100

If you still experience this problem, restart Postgres.

OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

This means that a Java process hasn't been allocated enough memory to function correctly.  You can increase the amount of memory by changing the `-Xmx` property in your `ANT_OPTS` environment variable.  We recommend `1000M` as a minimum, more is often needed during dataloading.  Your `ANT_OPTS` variable should include the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ echo $ANT_OPTS
	$ -Xmx1000M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M

OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space

This occurs when Java has run out for !PermGen space - where it stores !ClassLoaders and Class definitions, etc.  It can be fixed by increasing the `-XX:MaxPermSize` value in your `ANT_OPTS` environment variable, the default is `128M`, trying `256M` would be best.  The `ANT_OPTS` variable should include the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ echo $ANT_OPTS
	$-Xmx1000M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M

Can't find class name `ClassName`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	Exception caught: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown class name Protein in package org.intermine.model.bio

In this example a class named `Protein`  could not be found in the data model, this will usually arise when running a parser and attempting to create an `Item` for a class that does not exist.  Check your `sourcename_additions.xml` files to see if the class is listed, only the additions files for sources lists on `project.xml` when `ant build-db` was run will be included in the data model.

Can't find keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: java

	Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to find keys for source protfeatures_source in file protfeatures_source_keys.properties


It is expecting to find some keys to integrate data from that source. Do you have a keys file in the `bio/sources/protfeatures/resources`? 


Classpath issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Classpath issues can generate various errors, eg a conflict caused by `wstx-asl-3.2.4.jar` when the XMLOutputFactory created its StreamWriter in PathQueryBinding:

.. code-block:: java

	XMLStreamWriter writer = factory.createXMLStreamWriter(sw);

Session Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you get a session error when you first start up your webapp, update your Tomcat configuration to handle different URLs. See :doc:`/system-requirements/software/tomcat`.

.. index:: help, classpath, antlib-int.xml, keys, OutOfMemoryError, too many clients error, showProperties, logs, error messages

Client side errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you are using Google Chrome as your browser press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open a Debugger. In there click on the "Console" tab. If errors are present you should see them in red. If you want to inspect what kind of data are being sent/fetched, click on the Network Tab.

If you are using the List Widgets library ``(>= 1.2.4)`` then you can launch a "debug mode" on them. Simply wait for your page to load. Then append ``#debug`` at the end of the page URL. You should see buttons on individual widgets allowing you to see a debug trace of events happening.

Expose your localhost mine
--------------------------

It is easier to debug (especially CSS and JS issues) if we can see your mine from our end. If it is currently deployed on localhost, use `ngrok <https://ngrok.com//>`_.
