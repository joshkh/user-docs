Beta testing
================================

InterMine 1.3 will be released later this week. Prior to releasing the new software, we'd like your help testing. 

* Please test using the `intermine-1.3-beta` branch.
* If you've reported a bug, please let us know you are happy this bug is fixed.
* Minimally, we'd like you to release a webapp with the new software and test that it's working as expected.
* This release comes with some minor model changes so running a build and verifying the new model would be helpful.
   * AnnotationEvidence - each line of the GAF is now equal to an Evidence object (See https://github.com/intermine/intermine/issues/432)
   * Data set now has a publication reference
* After beta testing, the `intermine-1.3-beta` branch will be merged into the master and dev branches then deleted.
