Template Comparison
================================

There are template comparison scripts available under `intermine/scripts`, that will run queries against the templates publicly available in a mine or a pair of mines. The purpose of these scripts is to:

	* Test that all templates run.
	* In the case of multiple mines, check that updates haven't radically changed the results.

The scripts present their results on standard out, with the option to have them emailed upon completion of the comparison. To have results emailed out, you should have set up and installed `sendmail` on the machine running the comparison.

Scripts are available in Perl and Python. Installation of the Perl modules requires the installation of various dependencies, so many users may find the Python versions easier to install, since these
have fewer dependencies.

Python Script
----------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This script will run on `cPython` 2.5-2.7, `pypy` and `jython`. It requires the installation of the intermine client module, which can be installed from http://pypi.python.org PyPi with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo easy_install intermine


Invocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script can be invoked most simply against a single mine as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine

To have results emailed, add your email address:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine you@your.host.org

Optionally set a ''from'' address:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine you@your.host.org noreply@blackhole.net

Comparing against two mines is as above, except you simply need to add a second service location:

.. code-block:: bash

	python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine beta.flymine.org/beta you@your.host.org

Perl Script
----------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Perl script depends on the following modules: 

* `Webservice::InterMine` - the InterMine client library.
* `Email::Valid` - Optional email validation.
* `List::Util` - Core perl list extensions. [most systems will have this already]

These can be installed with the following command:
  
.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo cpan Webservice::InterMine Email::Valid List::Util

Invocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the script to compare two mines, or you can run the script to simply run all the templates in a mine.

Compare two mines, use one email address for both to and from


.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./compare_templates_for_releases mine-A mine-B email-address

Compare one mine to itself, use one email address for both to and from

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./compare_templates_for_releases mine-A email-address

Results
----------

The resulting email will look like this:

#. '''In Both: Diff >= 10%''' - templates run in both mines and result counts returned were very different.  
#. '''Only in''' - template was found in one mine and not the other.
#. '''In Both: Diff < 10%''' - template run in both mines and results returned were different.  It's probably safe to assume these are okay.
