Ant
===========

Installation Notes
-------------------

Several people have had problems with Ant installations set up by Linux package managers. We recommend installing Ant manually. 

 `Ant's manual <http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html>`_ has detailed instructions on how to install Ant.
 
 Make sure you don't have any ant-related jars on your classpath already, or else the InterMine build will fail.  

InterMine and Ant
-----------------

The InterMine project uses Ant for compiling code, building data models and databases and for running the data loading/integration process.  You shouldn't ever have to write new Ant XML, but you will run lots of Ant targets we have already defined.  These will usually compile some code, create databases or run particular Java code.

An example use is to create the tables and indexes for a new Mine in an empty PostgreSQL database.  In the `<mine>/dbmodel` directory we would do:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ant build-db


Whenever you use `ant` you can add a `-v` flag to get verbose output. We recommend doing this as it will give you detailed stack straces if a command fails:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ant -v build-db


You can pass parameters from the command line using `-Dparameter=value`. For example, when integrating data you can pass in a particular source name:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ant -v -Dsource=malaria-gff

Ant and the InterMine build system will ensure that all prerequisite code is compiled, the model is created and will create all tables and indexes based on the model.
