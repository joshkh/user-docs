InterMine User Tracking
================================


The following user activities are recorded during browsing of all mine webapps, to track the usage: 

* template query executions
* query executions from the QueryBuilder
* list creations by upload, operations (copy, union...) or from result tables
* list executions  
* searches by keyword
* user logins

The trackers, recording all tracks, are defined in the `global.web.properties` file under the property `webapp.trackers`.

All tracks are saved into specific tables, created automatically, if they don't already exist, in the userprofile database.

The tables are:

* templatetrack
* querytrack
* listtrack
* searchtrack
* logintrack

The table are created at the startup of the webapp. 

If some table definitions needed to be updated, the browsing of the webapp is blocked, and a warning message is displayed.

Run the ant task `update-templatetrack-table` in the webapp directory and then restart the webapp. 

Usage page in the webapp
-------------------------------

You can access to the *Usage* page, via the MyMine page, only if you are a superuser.

The page shows all tracks grouped in these sections: Template usage, Custom queries executed, Logins, Keyword Searches, List Analysis page views and List Creation.

Each section contains:

* a diagram showing the trend of that specific track during the time range selected: 1d, 5d, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y. The diagrams point out the number of tracks per day (number of template query execution, number the query execution....) without specify wich template or type query(Gene, Protein...) has been executed. 
* a table showing the number of tracks for each template, type of query, type of list....

Furthemore, in the ''Template usage'' section, there is a pie diagram showing the first 9 most popular templates and their number of executions in the time range selected: last 2 weeks, last month, last 3 months, last year.

Under the label 'Other' the number of executions of templates from 10th to 15th position.


Import/Export XML
-------------------------------

Import and export XML functionalities allow you to:

 * export all tracks from the userprofile database into an XML file
 * import all tracks from an XML file into the userprofile database 

The import functionality generates the tracker tables, if these haven't been created before.

When you release a webapp, you may need to recreate the userprofile database without losing all tracks saved until that moment.
Before running `create-db-userprofile`, execute `write-userprofile-xml` in order to save all the tracks into the `userprofile.xml` file.

The file has the following structure:

.. code-block:: xml

	<userprofiles>
	<tracks>
	<templatetracks>
	<templatetrack templatename="fourConstraints" username="butano@flymine.org" sessionidentifier="18FB96389B8C44817780B1B778C6F1C2" timestamp="2011-05-06 14:43:42.779"></templatetrack>
	...
	</templatetracks>
	<logintracks>
	<logintrack username="butano@flymine.org" timestamp="2011-05-17 16:27:38.729"></logintrack>
	...
	</logintracks>
	<listtracks>
	<listtrack type="Company" count="2" buildmode="IDENTIFIERS" event="CREATION" username="butano@flymine.org" sessionidentifier="65C4AD9C3C3EEC86FDB88BAC9EFFC7FF"
	timestamp="2011-05-18 09:42:16.905"></listtrack>
	...
	</listtracks>
	<querytracks>
	<querytrack type="Address" username="butano@flymine.org" sessionidentifier="EDD0090DE148413B1B35E8DFF2FE4CF1" timestamp="2011-05-18 10:40:29.961"></querytrack>
	...
	</querytracks>
	<searchtracks>
	<searchtrack keyword="CompanyA" username="" sessionidentifier="C83EAE50F49A7777E15C69AF31412839" timestamp="2011-05-18 12:38:09.0"></searchtrack>
	...
	</searchtracks></tracks></userprofiles>

Then run `create-db-userprofile` and `read-userprofile-xml`
